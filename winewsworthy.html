                From the day we arrive on the planet
                And, blinking, step into the sun
                There's more to see than can ever be seen
                More to do than can ever be done
                There's far too much to take in here
                More to find than can ever be found
                But the sun rolling high
                Through the sapphire sky
                Keeps great and small on the endless round.</p>

                <p>It's the circle of life
                    And it moves us all
                    Through despair and hope
                    Through faith and love
                    'Til we find our place
                    On the path unwinding
                    In the circle
                    The circle of life</p></div>

            I've been staring at the edge of the water
            'Long as I can remember
            Never really knowing why.</p>

            <p>I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                But I come back to the water
                No matter how hard I try.</p>
            <p>Every turn I take
                Every trail I track
                Every path I make
                Every road leads back
                To the place I know where I cannot go
                Where I long to be.</p>
            <p>See the line where the sky meets the sea?
                It calls me
                And no one knows
                How far it goes
                If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
                One day I'll know
                If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go

            Let's get down to business
            To defeat the Huns
            Did they send me daughters
            When I asked for sons?
            You're the saddest bunch I ever met
            But you can bet before we're through
            Mister, I'll make a man out of you</p>

            <p>Tranquil as a forest
                But on fire within
                Once you find your center
                You are sure to win
                You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
                And you haven't got a clue <span class="citation">"Somehow I'll make a man out of you."</span>
                I'm never gonna catch my breath
                Say goodbye to those who knew me
                Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?
                This guy's got them scared to death!
                Hope he doesn't see right through me
                Now I really wish that I knew how to swim</p>

            <p>We must be swift as the coursing river
                (Be a man)
                With all the force of a great typhoon
                (Be a man)
                With all the strength of a raging fire
                Mysterious as the dark side of the moon</p></div>
